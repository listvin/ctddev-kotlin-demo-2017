<b>Controls</b><br/>
Spinner items correspond to actions, that could be done with Link-Cut data structure:<br/>
• <code>connected</code> - test if the nodes are in the same tree<br/>
• <code>link</code> - create a new tree edge between two nodes<br/>
• <code>cut</code> - delete specific tree edge<br/>
• <code>size</code> - get the size of the tree, which contains the specified node<br/>
• <code>new</code> - creates new Link-Cut of specified size<br/>
After entering arguments (this could be also done by touching the nodes), hit Fire! button to apply operation.<br/>
Dice roll generates almost valid arguments<br/>
History button shows and hides sequence of performed operations with this tree<br/>
Help button you already know:)<p/>

<p><b>Legend</b><br/>
Dashed undirected edges are edges of represented trees<br/>
Dark directed edges on the picture are nodes of underlying Link-Cut's splays' edges<br/>
Light directed ones are "link" edges between decomposition paths</p>

<p>Have a nice doing of whatever you was going to do with this app...</p>
